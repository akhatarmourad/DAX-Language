# DAX Language for Power BI & Power Pivot

![Power BI DAX](./project-banner.png)

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to learning and mastering **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** language, which is widely used in **Power BI** and **Power Pivot**. DAX is a powerful functional language that allows you to create sophisticated data models, perform complex calculations, and gain deeper insights from your data.

## Sections & Details

I had the opportunity to explore and practice various aspects of the DAX language through the following key topics:

- **Conditions:** Filtering and creating new measures based on specific criteria.
- **Switches:** Handling multiple conditions and outputs using the `SWITCH` function.
- **Formulas for Aggregation:** Aggregating data with functions like `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `COUNTROWS`.
- **Navigation Functions:** Accessing data from related tables with functions like `RELATED`, `LOOKUPVALUE`.
- **Understanding Context:** Managing row and filter contexts in dynamic calculations.
- **Types of Tables:** Creating calculated and summarized tables using DAX functions.
- **Data Modeling:** Building efficient data models with relationships, hierarchies, and joins.
